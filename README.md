To launch the GUI, run `application/main.py` with python. Requires the Tkinter package, but it should come with Python 3.x.

## Current Progress
- Topside/GUI currently works for modifying one or more answers in a specific Typeform submission.

## To Do
- Write server script to process the requested changes and send confirmation email once changes have been successfully processed.
- Add more functionalities? Do we need add/delete for Typeform? Should we add the ability to change Google Sheets or other data?
- Make stand-alone executable, probably using PyInstaller.
